Spam Email Classification Using Machine Learning
Project Overview:
This project focuses on automated spam detection by developing a Logistic Regression-based machine learning model. The model efficiently classifies emails as spam or non-spam, helping users filter out unwanted or potentially harmful messages. To achieve high accuracy, the project implements extensive text preprocessing techniques and employs TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction.

Key Features & Methodology:
ðŸ”¹ Text Preprocessing for Cleaner Data:

Tokenization: Breaking down the text into individual words for better analysis.

Stopword Removal: Eliminating commonly used words (e.g., "the", "is", "and") to focus on meaningful terms.

Lowercase Conversion: Standardizing text to avoid case-sensitivity issues in model training.

ðŸ”¹ Feature Extraction Using TF-IDF:

Transforms text data into a numerical format, highlighting important words while reducing the impact of frequently occurring but unimportant words.

Helps the model distinguish spam-related terms from regular email content effectively.

.. Machine Learning Model - Logistic Regression:

Chosen due to its efficiency in binary classification tasks (spam vs. non-spam).

Trained on a labeled dataset to learn patterns of spam emails.

 ..Model Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: Measures overall correctness in predictions.

Precision: Ensures the model does not wrongly classify legitimate emails as spam.

Recall: Ensures spam emails are effectively detected.

F1-score: A balance between precision and recall, providing a holistic performance measure.

Tech Stack Used:
 Python â€“ Core programming language for model development.
 Logistic Regression â€“ Machine learning algorithm for classification.
 TF-IDF â€“ Feature extraction technique for text processing.
 Pandas & NumPy â€“ For data handling and numerical computations.
